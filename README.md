### Configuring System Prompts

System prompts help guide AI coding assistants to better understand your preferences and project requirements. Setting up effective system prompts can significantly improve the quality of AI-generated code.

#### Setting Up System Prompts in GitHub Copilot
Source: [GitHub Copilot Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization)
GitHub Copilot allows you to configure custom instructions that influence how it generates code, test, code review and commit messages:

1. **Using Custom Instructions File**:
- Create a file named `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your project root.
- Write clear instructions in markdown format about your coding preferences, style guidelines, and project-specific requirements.
- Copilot will incorporate these instructions when generating code suggestions.

Example of a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file:

```markdown
# Project Coding Guidelines

## General Guidelines
- Use Python 3.9+ features and syntax
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Keep functions focused and small (max 20 lines)
- Include docstrings for all public functions and classes

## FastAPI Specific
- Use Pydantic models for request/response schemas
- Implement proper error handling with HTTP status codes
- Group related endpoints under router objects
- Use dependency injection for shared resources
- Include OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints

## Project Structure
- Place route handlers in `app/routers/`
- Store database models in `app/models/`
- Keep Pydantic schemas in `app/schemas/`
- Put business logic in `app/services/`
- Use `app/core/` for application configuration

## Testing
- Write pytest test cases for all endpoints
- Include both positive and negative test scenarios
- Mock external dependencies
- Test status codes and response structures
```

2. **Using VS Code Settings**:
- Open VS Code settings (Ctrl+, or Cmd+, on macOS).
- Search for "github.copilot.chat".
- Configure the following settings for different scenarios:
  - `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions` for code generation
  - `github.copilot.chat.testGeneration.instructions` for test generation
  - `github.copilot.chat.reviewSelection.instructions` for code review

Example of VS Code settings for GitHub Copilot:
```json
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
    {
      "text": "Always add a comment: 'Generated by Copilot'."
    },
    {
      "text": "In TypeScript always use underscore for private field names."
    },
    {
      "file": "code-style.md" // import instructions from file `code-style.md`
    }
  ],

```

3. **Using Prompt Files**:
- Configure the `chat.promptFiles` setting to `true`.
- Create `.prompt.md` files in the `.github/prompts` directory.
- Write instructions using markdown formatting.
- Reference additional workspace files as needed.
- Attach these prompt files to chat requests using the "Attach Context" icon or Ctrl+/ (Cmd+/ on macOS).

## Setting Up Cursor (Free Account)

Cursor is an AI-enhanced code editor built on VS Code that offers powerful AI assistance. It provides a free tier with essential features that can be valuable during a hackathon.

### Installation Process for Windows

To install Cursor on Windows:

1. Visit the official Cursor website at [cursor.com](https://www.cursor.com/).

2. Click on "Download for Windows" to download the installer.

![Cursor download for Windows](/images/cursor-download-windows.png)

3. Once downloaded, locate the installer in your Downloads folder.

4. Double-click on the installer to begin the installation process.

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

6. Launch Cursor after installation completes.

7. The application will prompt you to create an account or sign in. You can use the free tier without requiring payment information.

8. After signing in, you can start using Cursor's basic AI features immediately.

### Installation Process for macOS

For macOS users:

1. Go to cursor.com and click on "Download for Mac".

2. The cursor installer will be downloaded to your Downloads folder.

3. Double-click on the downloaded file to extract the installer. You may need to right-click and select "Open" if you receive a warning about an app downloaded from the internet.

4. Drag the Cursor app to your Applications folder.

5. Launch Cursor from your Applications folder.

6. Create an account or sign in when prompted. The free tier is available without payment information.

7. Once signed in, you can begin using Cursor's AI coding features.

### Installation Process for Linux (Ubuntu)

For Linux users, particularly Ubuntu:

1. Visit cursor.com and download the Linux installer (typically an AppImage file).

2. Open your terminal and navigate to your Downloads folder.

3. Make the AppImage file executable with the command:

```bash
chmod +x cursor-[version]-[build]-x86_64.AppImage
```
Example:
![Cursor chmod](/images/cursor-linux-chmod.png)

4. If you encounter an error about libfuse.so.2, install FUSE by running:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libfuse2
```

5. Run the AppImage file:
```bash
./cursor-[version]-[build]-x86_64.AppImage
```
Example:
![Cursor exec](/images/cursor-linux-exec.png)

6. For easier access, move the AppImage to the /opt folder:
```bash
sudo mv cursor-[version]-[build]-x86_64.AppImage /opt/cursor.appimage
```
From now you can open the app by running:
```bash
/opt/cursor.appimage
```

### Setting Up Instructions (Rules) for Cursor

Source: [Cursor Rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai)

Setting up Rules for Cursor can be done both globally and on a project-specific basis:

#### Global Rules

1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Navigate to General > Rules for AI
3. Enter custom instructions in the provided text area
4. Click "Save" to apply the global rules

These global rules will apply to all projects you work on in Cursor.

#### Project-Specific Rules

1. Create a `.cursorrules` file in the root directory of your project
2. Open the file in a text editor
3. Add custom instructions for the specific project

Alternatively, Cursor is moving towards a new Project Rules system:

1. Create a `.cursor.json` or `.cursor-settings.yaml` file in the project directory
2. Define project-specific settings in this file, which can include AI preferences, development environment settings, and more

It's worth noting that the `.cursorrules` file method is being phased out, so it's recommended to transition to the new Project Rules system for better flexibility and control.

Both global and project-specific rules allow you to customize Cursor AI's behavior, including coding style preferences, best practices, and project-specific requirements. This customization helps ensure more accurate and consistent code generation tailored to your needs.
